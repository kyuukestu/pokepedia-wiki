## Who is a Trainer?

A Pokémon Trainer is any person who catches, trains, cares for, or battles with Pokémon! Starting from the age of ten (10), anyone can apply for a Trainer's Card, which—upon approval—recognizes them as a League-Registered Pokémon Trainer.

Trainer Cards are essential for gaining access to the full suite of League-affiliated services, including:

- PokéMart
- PokéCenter
- Daycare & Breeding Facilities
- Gyms, Battle Frontier, Battle Tower, etc.
- League Sponsored Events & Competitions

In spite of their common referral as 'Trainer Cards', the more accurate term would be 'Trainer ID' as they encompass all means of identification and can take many forms depending on the region and the personal preference of the trainer.

Common Types of Trainer ID and their uniques features are explored below:
