## Who is a Trainer?

A Pokémon Trainer is any person who catches, trains, cares for, or battles with Pokémon! Starting from the age of ten (10), anyone can apply for a Trainer's Card, which—upon approval—recognizes them as a League-Registered Pokémon Trainer.

Trainer Cards are essential for gaining access to the full suite of League-affiliated services, including:

- PokéMart
- PokéCenter
- Daycare & Breeding Facilities
- Gyms, Battle Frontier, Battle Tower, etc.
- League Sponsored Events & Competitions

In spite of their common referral as 'Trainer Cards', the more accurate term would be 'Trainer ID' as they encompass all means of identification and can take many forms depending on the region and the personal preference of the trainer.

Common Types of Trainer ID and their uniques features are explored below:

> [!CAUTION]
> Trainers who are found to be involved with illegal or criminal activity may find themselves at risk of their trainer ids being revoked!

## The Carry Limit

It is tradition and expected that trainers carry no more than six (6) pokémon on them at any time.

While this may be an unspoken rule, meaning it is not strictly enforced, the League frowns upon trainers who exceed the traditional six (6) without reason.

Pokémon are, after all, extremely powerful creatures and those trainers who feel the need to carry around a what is effectively a small army will invite scrutiny and suspicion.

That said, there are many exceptions to this rule where the League will grant temporary permission for a Trainer to exceed the Carry Limit. A permit can be obtained from League Officials (such as the Regional Professor) for trainers who, for example:

- Are nursing young pokémon who would benefit from the close proximity to their trainer
- Have health issues that require a guide-pokemon

Alternatively, Trainers may purchase a mobile PC unit that allows them to access the Pokémon Storage System from almost anywhere.

However, Tournaments and public institutions such as hotels or parks are under no obligation to accommodate trainers who exceed the standard six (6).

## Pokémon Permits

Unfortunately, not every trainer can be trusted not to barrel down the streets at 250 km/h on their newly evolved, far too eager Arcanine. Permits act as the Role Play equivalent of Licenses and certify a trainer as sufficiently trained to ride Pokémon to traverse:

- [Land](trainers101.terrestrial-permit.md)
- [Sea](trainers101.aquatic-permit.md)
- [Sky](trainers101.aviation-permit.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Largely flavor text and not strictly enforced in RP, trainers who ride their pokémon are assumed to do so safely unless stated otherwise.
