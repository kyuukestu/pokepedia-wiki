## Who is a Trainer?

A Pokémon Trainer is any person who catches, trains, cares for, or battles with Pokémon! Starting from the age of ten (10), anyone can apply for a Trainer's Card which, upon its approval, recognizes them as a League Registered Pokémon trainer!

Trainer Cards are required to obtain access to the full suite of League-related services: the PokéMart, PokéCenter, Daycare, etc.

Despite their name, trainer cards come in many forms:
