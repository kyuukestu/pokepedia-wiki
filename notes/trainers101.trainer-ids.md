Born of Galar's enthusiastic sports culture, the League Card allows holders to display their stats and accomplishments in stylized and personalize trading-cards which they can shared or traded between friends. The League Cards of popular trainers are highly valued by collectors.

### Profile App

The most digital of the bunch, the Profile App is downloadable on any device and allows trainers to view not just their personal accomplishments: Badges, Pokédex Completion, and Tournament record amongst other; but, it also syncs to Pokémon Storage System, allowing trainers to display their active pokémon alongside their profiles.
