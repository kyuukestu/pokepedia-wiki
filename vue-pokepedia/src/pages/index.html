			<h>Welcome to our Pokémon Role Play Wikia! Poképedia for short</h>
			<p>
				Welcome to the Poképedia! An ever-expanding compendium of useful
				information about the World of Pokémon as presented in the Role Play!
			</p>
			<p>
				This wikia serves to answer many, eventually any, of the questions that
				inevitable arise when roleplaying in a world as diverse and long-running
				as pokémon. It covers basic information on the Pokémon World and any
				changes that arise as a result of RP events or OOC decisions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whether you're a seasoned member of the role play or just starting our,
				this Wikia is your go-to resource for lore, mechanic changes, locations,
				rules, Ocs (maybe), and more.

			<h2>What Is This Role Play About?</h2>
			<p>
				We run an Open-World, Sandbox-style Pokémon RP where the entire
				Pokéverse is your Cloyster!
			</p>
			<p>
				What's that all mean? It means when we role play, we draw from all forms
				of Poké-Media: The **Main Series Games** are our primary source, but
				Side Games (Ranger, Conquest, Mystery Dungeon, et al.), Anime, Manga,
				etc. are all valid sources from which to draw inspiration to flesh-out
				the world. Our role play introduces new regions, factions, lore,
				regional variants, and many more that expand the Pokémon experience!
