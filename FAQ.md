# Frequently Asked Questions

<!-- TODO: Add Links where relevant -->

## Can I still join the RP even though it's been going on for a while?

Yes! We spin off our events into their own mini-threads which provide an easy opportunity for someone to join. We also have a Discord where you can ask questions and get to know the others Rpers and their characters to see if you'd be interested in joining them.

We're trying to make this as beginner-friendly as possible, please bear with us.

## I don't have a Discord, can I still join?

Yes! We have an OOC thread as well as extra pages that will assist to keep non-Discord users up-to-date on happenings.

## How often do I need to post?

We ask that you try to post at least once a week; however, we understand that life happens and are willing to work with you if you need more time. Please notify us whenever you have challenge.

During events or story arcs, we adopt a Three-Strike Warning Policy. After roughly a week of absence, you will be given a verbal warning. After three warnings, we will consider you unable to post and will discuss with you how the other people in the scene can progress with or without further input from your character.

## Can I have legendary Pokémon?

Yes, but many of the more powerful ones are Off-limits. For example, no one is going to be allowed to catch Pokémon who have major lore implications (Arceus, Dialga, Palkia, etc.). However, Pokémon that don't maintain the fabric of reality itself are more likely to be capturable.

We have a list of what Legendary can & cannot be captured, please PM for more details.

## Do the Pokémon Leagues in every region run concurrently?

No! We have chosen to stagger the League by one month each and given them a 9-month 'On Season' and a 3-month 'Off Season'. This is the same for Contest Circuits which are also staggered and followed the 9-On, 3-Off format.

The World Coronation Series, however, has a 10-month 'On Season' and a 2-month 'Off Season'.

## How do you handle the release of new games?

We deal with it as they come! We will have a discussion about how to resolve any changes to lore/canon and also how to introduce the new region or any changes to the region or Pokémon that have been made by remakes.

## Can I have a Mega Evolution?

Yes! However, Mega Evolution is—lore wise—considered to be on-par with even some legendaries. An OC is only allowed to have one 'legendary tier' Pokémon, whether this be a Mega Evolution, Battle Bond, or actual legendary. In addition, all these Pokémon of immense power must be obtained in-RP. You cannot start with them.

## Dynamax? Z-Moves? Terastalization?

Yes, yes, and yes! However, we do follow the canon restrictions on these so you will need the appropriate equipment (Z-rings, Dynamax band, etc.) and in some cases the right location.

## Can I play as a Pokémon

Yes! Though I must admit, we have few role players who desire that and so we cater primarily to Trainer OCs.
