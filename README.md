# Welcome to our Pokémon Role Play Wikia! Poképedia for short

Welcome to the Poképedia! An ever-expanding compendium of useful information about the World of Pokémon as presented in the Role Play! This wikia serves to answer many, eventually any, of the questions that inevitable arise when roleplaying in a world as diverse and long-running as pokémon.

It covers basic information on the Pokémon World and any changes that arise as a result of RP events or OOC decisions. Whether you're a seasoned member of the role play or just starting our, this Wikia is your go-to resource for lore, mechanic changes, locations, rules, Ocs (maybe), and more.

## What Is This Role Play About?

We run an Open-World, Sandbox-style Pokémon RP where the entire Pokéverse is your Cloyster!

What's that all mean? It means when we role play, we draw from all forms of Poké-Media: The **Main Series Games** are our primary source, but Side Games (Ranger, Conquest, Mystery Dungeon, et al.), Anime, Manga, etc. are all valid sources from which to draw inspiration to flesh-out the world.

Our role play introduces new regions, factions, lore, regional variants, and many more that expand the Pokémon experience!

## What You'll Find Here

- **Character Profiles**: Covers the status of major Trainers, Pokémon, and NPCs that populate the world. (Eventually, we'll add OC pages as well.)
- **Region and Location Guides**: Info on each region and how they've been expanded or changed throughout the RP or in connection to their real-world counter-parts.
- **Role Play Rules and Mechanics**: Guides to the mechanics that keep our world fair and fun.
- **Job and Rank Systems**: Discover how your trainer can rise through the ranks and take on special roles within the world such as Gym Leader, Ranger, Police Officer, etc.
- **Event Archives**: Catch up on major story arcs and role play events.
- **Pokémon Information**: Regional variants, availability, and lore-specific evolutions.
- **And More..!**
